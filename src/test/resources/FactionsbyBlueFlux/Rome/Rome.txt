^  For a certain order to be established in an Empire,
you must make an example of those who do not follow
your laws. Decent treatment surpresses riots better
than any police, but a lack of police creates a riot.

for all!"

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, your ideals are admirable if a bit
misguided and your faction need not pose a threat to
Roman Law. Shall we sign a Treaty of Friendship to formalize
our symbiotic relationship?

"As you wish. The Empire seems a valuable friend."
"No. Your empire is a threat to all humans who live
on Chiron, $NAME3."

"$TITLE0 $NAME1, my noninterference philosophies would

of Friendship and coexist in peace?

"Rome: safe ally. Treaty: admirable idea."
"Rome: control: too important. Ally: dangerous. Answer:
no."
